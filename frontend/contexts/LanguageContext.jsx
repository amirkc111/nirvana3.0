    // FAQ Content
    faq1Question: "How accurate are your astrological predictions?",
    faq1Answer: "Our predictions are based on traditional Vedic astrology principles combined with modern astronomical data. While we strive for accuracy, astrology is a guidance tool and should be used alongside your own intuition and decision-making.",
    faq2Question: "What information do I need to provide for a Kundli analysis?",
    faq2Answer: "For an accurate Kundli analysis, we need your date of birth, time of birth, and place of birth. The more precise the birth time, the more accurate your chart will be.",
    faq3Question: "How often should I check my horoscope?",
    faq3Answer: "Daily horoscopes provide general guidance for the day. For major life decisions, we recommend consulting your detailed birth chart and considering planetary transits.",
    faq4Question: "Can I get a consultation with a real astrologer?",
    faq4Answer: "Yes! We offer personalized consultations with certified Vedic astrologers. You can book a session through our contact form or chat with our AI cosmic guide for immediate assistance.",
    faq5Question: "Is my personal information secure?",
    faq5Answer: "Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption to protect your personal data and birth information. Your privacy is our top priority.",
    faq6Question: "What is the difference between Vedic and Western astrology?",

    faq7Question: "How do I interpret my birth chart?",
    faq7Answer: "Our detailed Kundli analysis provides explanations for each planet's position and influence. We also offer guided interpretations to help you understand your cosmic blueprint.",
    faq8Question: "Can astrology predict the future?",
    faq8Answer: "Astrology provides insights into potential trends and influences, but it doesn't predict fixed outcomes. It's a tool for understanding cosmic energies and making informed decisions.",

    // FAQ Content
    faq1Question: "तपाईंका ज्योतिषीय भविष्यवाणीहरू कति सटीक छन्?",
    faq1Answer: "हाम्रा भविष्यवाणीहरू पारम्परिक वैदिक ज्योतिष सिद्धान्तहरू र आधुनिक खगोलीय डेटाको संयोजनमा आधारित छन्। हामी सटीकताका लागि प्रयास गर्छौं, तर ज्योतिष एक मार्गदर्शन उपकरण हो र यसलाई तपाईंको आफ्नो अन्तर्ज्ञान र निर्णय लिने क्षमतासँग प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ।",
    faq2Question: "कुण्डली विश्लेषणका लागि मलाई कुन जानकारी प्रदान गर्नुपर्छ?",
    faq2Answer: "सटीक कुण्डली विश्लेषणका लागि, हामीलाई तपाईंको जन्म मिति, जन्म समय, र जन्म स्थान चाहिन्छ। जन्म समय जति सटीक हुन्छ, तपाईंको चार्ट पनि त्यति सटीक हुन्छ।",
    faq3Question: "मैले कति बेर आफ्नो राशिफल जाँच गर्नुपर्छ?",
    faq3Answer: "दैनिक राशिफलहरूले दिनका लागि सामान्य मार्गदर्शन प्रदान गर्छन्। प्रमुख जीवन निर्णयहरूका लागि, हामी तपाईंको विस्तृत जन्म चार्ट र ग्रहीय ट्रान्जिटहरू विचार गर्न सल्लाह दिन्छौं।",
    faq4Question: "के मैले वास्तविक ज्योतिषीसँग परामर्श प्राप्त गर्न सक्छु?",
    faq4Answer: "हो! हामी प्रमाणित वैदिक ज्योतिषीहरूसँग व्यक्तिगत परामर्श प्रदान गर्छौं। तपाईं हाम्रो सम्पर्क फर्मको माध्यमबाट सत्र बुक गर्न सक्नुहुन्छ वा तुरुन्त सहयोगका लागि हाम्रो AI ब्रह्माण्डीय गाइडसँग कुराकानी गर्न सक्नुहुन्छ।",
    faq5Question: "के मेरो व्यक्तिगत जानकारी सुरक्षित छ?",
    faq5Answer: "बिल्कुल। हामी तपाईंको व्यक्तिगत डेटा र जन्म जानकारीलाई सुरक्षा गर्न उद्योग-मानक इन्क्रिप्शन प्रयोग गर्छौं। तपाईंको गोपनीयता हाम्रो सर्वोच्च प्राथमिकता हो।",
    faq6Question: "वैदिक र पश्चिमी ज्योतिष बीच कुन फरक छ?",
    faq6Answer: "वैदिक ज्योतिषले साइडरियल राशिचक्र प्रयोग गर्छ र चन्द्रमाको स्थितिमा केन्द्रित हुन्छ, जबकि पश्चिमी ज्योतिषले ट्रपिकल राशिचक्र प्रयोग गर्छ। वैदिक ज्योतिष अधिक पारम्परिक र आध्यात्मिक रूपमा केन्द्रित हुन्छ।",
    faq7Question: "मैले आफ्नो जन्म चार्ट कसरी व्याख्या गर्ने?",
    faq7Answer: "हाम्रो विस्तृत कुण्डली विश्लेषणले प्रत्येक ग्रहको स्थिति र प्रभावका लागि व्याख्याहरू प्रदान गर्छ। हामी तपाईंले आफ्नो ब्रह्माण्डीय ब्लूप्रिन्ट बुझ्न मद्दत गर्न निर्देशित व्याख्याहरू पनि प्रदान गर्छौं।",
    faq8Question: "के ज्योतिषले भविष्य भविष्यवाणी गर्न सक्छ?",
    faq8Answer: "ज्योतिषले सम्भावित प्रवृत्तिहरू र प्रभावहरूका बारेमा अन्तर्दृष्टि प्रदान गर्छ, तर यसले निश्चित परिणामहरू भविष्यवाणी गर्दैन। यो ब्रह्माण्डीय ऊर्जाहरू बुझ्न र सूचित निर्णय लिने उपकरण हो।",

    // FAQ Content
    faq1Question: "Kuinka tarkkoja astrologiset ennusteet ovat?",
    faq1Answer: "Ennusteemme perustuvat perinteisiin vedisiin astrologian periaatteisiin yhdistettynä moderniin tähtitieteelliseen dataan. Pyrimme tarkkuuteen, mutta astrologia on ohjaustyökalu ja sitä tulisi käyttää oman intuitiosi ja päätöksentekokykysi rinnalla.",
    faq2Question: "Mitä tietoja tarvitsen Kundli-analyysiä varten?",
    faq2Answer: "Tarkkaa Kundli-analyysiä varten tarvitsemme syntymäpäiväsi, syntymäaikasi ja syntymäpaikkasi. Mitä tarkempi syntymäaika on, sitä tarkempi karttasi on.",
    faq3Question: "Kuinka usein horoskoppini pitäisi tarkistaa?",
    faq3Answer: "Päivittäiset horoskoopit tarjoavat yleistä ohjausta päivälle. Suurten elämänpäätösten osalta suosittelemme konsultoimaan yksityiskohtaista syntymäkarttaasi ja harkitsemaan planeettien transiitteja.",
    faq4Question: "Voinko saada konsultaation oikean astrologin kanssa?",
    faq4Answer: "Kyllä! Tarjoamme henkilökohtaisia konsultaatioita sertifioitujen vedisten astrologien kanssa. Voit varata istunnon yhteydenottolomakkeemme kautta tai chattailla AI-kosmisoppaamme kanssa välittömään apuun.",
    faq5Question: "Onko henkilötietoni turvassa?",
    faq5Answer: "Ehdottomasti. Käytämme alan standardeja noudattavaa salausmenetelmää henkilötietojesi ja syntymätietojesi suojaamiseen. Yksityisyytesi on ykkösprioriteettimme.",
    faq6Question: "Mikä on ero vedisen ja länsimaisen astrologian välillä?",
    faq6Answer: "Vedinen astrologia käyttää sideraalista eläinrataa ja keskittyy kuun asemaan, kun länsimainen astrologia käyttää trooppista eläinrataa. Vedinen astrologia on perinteisempi ja henkisesti suuntautunut.",
    faq7Question: "Miten tulkitsen syntymäkarttani?",
    faq7Answer: "Yksityiskohtainen Kundli-analyysimme tarjoaa selityksiä jokaisen planeetan asemalle ja vaikutukselle. Tarjoamme myös ohjattuja tulkintoja auttamaan sinua ymmärtämään kosmisen sinettisi.",
    faq8Question: "Voiko astrologia ennustaa tulevaisuutta?",
    faq8Answer: "Astrologia tarjoaa näkemyksiä mahdollisista trendeistä ja vaikutuksista, mutta se ei ennusta kiinteitä lopputuloksia. Se on työkalu kosmisten energioiden ymmärtämiseen ja informoitujen päätösten tekemiseen.",
