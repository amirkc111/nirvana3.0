- day: Day of birth/event (number)
- month: Month of birth/event (number)
- year: Year of birth/event (number)
- btime: Time of birth/event (HH:MM, 24-hour format)
- timezone: Time zone (decimal, e.g. 5.5 for IST)

- longitude: Longitude (decimal, East +ve, West -ve)
- inputTextToSave: JHD file text (textarea, optional)
- submit: Calculate (button to trigger calculation)

Outputs (Main Page Results):
---------------------------
- Panchanga summary (date, time, place, timezone, lat/lon)
- Save JHD link (to download chart data)
- Main chart (table):
    - 12 houses, each cell shows planets/signs and their degrees (e.g. Sa13.28, Ke19.05)
    - Center cell shows day, nakshatra, tithi, etc.
- (Depending on calculation, may also show additional tables or panchanga details)

How it works:
-------------
- User fills the form (or loads a .JHD file)
- On submit, the page calculates the chart and panchanga
- The chart is rendered as an HTML table (see <table class="chart">)
- All calculations are performed client-side using JavaScript (sjp.js and related scripts)

To automate extraction:
----------------------
- You can fill the form via query parameters (GET), e.g. SJP.html?day=30&month=6&year=1996&btime=01:30&timezone=5.5&placename=Gulmi&latitude=28.0&longitude=83.9856
- The output chart can be extracted from the DOM (table.chart) after calculation.
