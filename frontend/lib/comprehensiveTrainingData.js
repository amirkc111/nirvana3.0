SS X.Our PartnersWe have worked with 50+ partnersUnlock Your Future with Astrology: Horoscope Readings, Birth Chart Analysis, and More Astrology is a predictive science that empowers astrologers to delve into an individual's unique traits from birth, revealing strengths, weaknesses, and potential life paths. By studying the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the time of birth, astrologers offer valuable insights into various life aspects. Astroyogi provides access to different schools of astrology, including Vedic astrology, Western astrology, and Chinese astrology, helping you understand and utilize astrology for personal growth and well-being. The astrological chart, commonly known as the \"Horoscope,\" serves as a roadmap for analyzing one's future, preferences, and potential life events. India has gifted the world the profound science of Vedic astrology, which calculates the impact of planetary movements on human lives. For centuries, astrology has guided individuals toward happiness and success, providing solace and direction during challenging times. Astroyogi brings this ancient wisdom to your fingertips, connecting you with expert astrologers who can serve as guides, friends, and counselors on your life journey. We offer a range of services, including horoscope readings, birth chart analysis, and personalized astrology predictions to help you navigate life's complexities. Let's explore the two prominent branches of astrology: Indian Astrology and Western Astrology. Indian Astrology (Vedic Astrology) Indian astrology, also known as Vedic astrology, boasts a rich history dating back centuries. It is based on the movements of stars and planets, incorporating astrological signs and their corresponding dates (zodiacs) for a comprehensive understanding. Vedic astrology considers 27 constellations, 9 planets, 12 zodiac signs, and 12 houses, analyzing their influence on an individual's life. Astrology by date of birth is used to create a horoscope chart, which displays the placement of the 9 planets within the 12 houses at the time of birth. Expert astrologers interpret this chart to assess the impact of planetary positions on various life aspects, offering personalized horoscope readings and astrological signs interpretations. Within Vedic astrology, various schools of thought exist, each with unique approaches to prediction and guidance. For example, some schools emphasize planetary periods (dashas), while others focus on specific astrological combinations (yogas). Vedic astrology is used for a wide range of purposes, including predicting marriage compatibility, career prospects, financial trends, and health outcomes. Western Astrology Western astrology employs an equatorial zodiac system based on the equator points. This system emphasizes the precise time of birth for generating horoscopes and making predictions. Western astrology tracks the movements of the Sun, planets, and Moon, considering their positions in the 12 houses of a birth chart. Similar to Vedic astrology, Western astrology uses birth chart analysis to understand an individual's personality, strengths, and weaknesses. However, Western astrology differs from Vedic astrology in its interpretation of planetary influences and its emphasis on psychological aspects of personality. Western astrologers often use techniques like transit analysis and progression analysis to predict future trends and events. Astrology Chart (Natal Chart) An astrology chart, also known as a natal chart, maps the positions of the planets around the Sun at the moment of an individual's birth. This chart reveals a person's inherent strengths and weaknesses, indicating opportune times for decision-making and personal growth. Birth chart analysis is a cornerstone of both Vedic and Western astrology, providing valuable insights for astrological signs and horoscope readings. Here's what astrologers consider when analyzing a birth chart: The position of each planet in the 12 houses The placement of the Moon, Venus, and Mars Jupiter\u2019s placement for luck and opportunities Saturn\u2019s placement for challenges and areas requiring effort Aspects formed between two planets The balance of the four elements (fire, water, earth, and air) Whether elements are cardinal, fixed, or mutable The presence of stelliums (three or more planets in a single house) A skilled astrologer on Astroyogi will consider these factors and perform detailed calculations to provide accurate astrology predictions. If the birth chart reveals an imbalance in certain traits, the astrologer can suggest remedies and practices to restore equilibrium. This process, known as balancing the chart, is crucial for realizing your full potential and achieving happiness and success.

March brings excellent options and solutions for career elevation, earning opportunities, and romantic wealth, making it an ideal time for progress and advancement. However, the South Node may complicate love life, and health status may be fragile, requiring extra care and attention. From April, planets inspire big thinking, and Venus brings harmony to love life, but North Node may encourage undue risk-taking, disrupting financial planning, and requiring careful consideration and prudence. Jupiter blesses education, and health improves, bringing a sense of well-being and vitality. May requires careful relationship navigation due to North Node\u2019s influence, and June is ideal for making a statement at work, and Venus enhances finances, but recent issues may disrupt love life, needing empathy and understanding. Saturn focuses on healthy habits, and Mars maintains enthusiasm through physical activities, promoting a balanced lifestyle. August brings challenges at work, financial difficulties, and complicated relationship matters, but Venus provides strength to deal with these issues, and Saturn indicates a pause in personal life, allowing for reflection and introspection. Venus offers connections beyond your social circle, broadening your horizons and perspectives. By year-end, Jupiter brings amusement, bliss, and professional growth, while Saturn demands readiness for new challenges, and if suffering from ailments, this phase aids recovery, and pending business matters can be resolved, bringing a sense of closure and completion. December is special for love and relationships, with Venus displaying love and devotion, and Mars bringing enthusiasm and flirtation, making it an ideal time for new romantic experiences and deepening connections.

The Vedas are the primary texts of Hinduism. They also had a vast influence on Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Traditionally the text of the Vedas was coeval with the universe. Scholars have determined that the Rig Veda, the oldest of the four Vedas, was composed about 1500 B.C., and codified about 600 B.C. It is unknown when it was finally committed to writing, but this probably was at some point after 300 B.C. The Vedas contain hymns, incantations, and rituals from ancient India. Along with the Book of the Dead, the Enuma Elish, the I Ching, and the Avesta, they are among the most ancient religious texts still in existence. Besides their spiritual value, they also give a unique view of everyday life in India four thousand years ago. The Vedas are also the most ancient extensive texts in an Indo-European language, and as such are invaluable in the study of comparative linguistics. Rig Veda The Rig-Veda translated by Ralph Griffith [1896] A complete English translation of the Rig Veda. Rig-Veda (Sanskrit) The complete Rig Veda in Sanskrit, in Unicode Devanagari script and standard romanization. Vedic Hymns, Part I (SBE 32) Hymns to the Maruts, Rudra, V\u00e2yu and V\u00e2ta, tr. by F. Max M\u00fcller [1891] A masterpiece of linguistics and comparative mythology: translations and deep analysis of the Vedic Hymns to the Storm Gods. Vedic Hymns, Part II (SBE 46) Hymns to Agni, tr. by Hermann Oldenberg [1897] The Vedic Hymns to Agni. A Vedic Reader for Students (excerpts) by A.A. Macdonell [1917] An introduction to the Dramatis Person\u00e6 of the Rig Veda. Sama Veda The Sama-Veda translated by Ralph Griffith [1895] A collection of hymns used by the priests during the Soma sacrifice. Many of these duplicate in part or in whole hymns from the Rig Veda. This is a complete translation. Yajur Veda The Yajur Veda (Taittiriya Sanhita) translated by Arthur Berriedale Keith [1914] A complete translation of the Black Yajur Veda. The Yajur Veda is a detailed manual of the Vedic sacrificial rites. The Texts of the White Yajurveda translated by Ralph T.H. Griffith [1899] A complete translation of the White Yajur Veda. Atharva Veda The Atharva Veda also contains material from the Rig Veda, but of interest are the numerous incantations and metaphysical texts, which this anthology (part of the Sacred Books of the East series) collects and categorizes. The Atharva Veda was written down much later than the rest of the Vedas, about 200 B.C.; it may have been composed about 1000 B.C. The Hymns of the Atharvaveda translated by Ralph T.H. Griffith [1895-6] The unabridged Atharva Veda translation by Ralph Griffith. The Atharva-Veda translated by Maurice Bloomfield [1897] (Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 42) The Sacred Books of the East translation of the Atharva-veda. Selected hymns from the Atharva-veda. Upanishads The Upanishads are a continuation of the Vedic philosophy, and were written between 800 and 400 B.C. They elaborate on how the soul (Atman) can be united with the ultimate truth (Brahman) through contemplation and mediation, as well as the doctrine of Karma-- the cumulative effects of a persons' actions. The Upanishads (Sacred Books of the East, vols. 1 and 15): The Upanishads, Part I (SBE 1) Max M\u00fcller, translator [1879] The Chandogya, Talavakara, Aitreya-Aranyaka, the Kaushitaki-Brahmana, and the Vajasaneyi Samhita Upanishads The Upanishads, Part II (SBE 15) Max M\u00fcller, translator [1884] Katha, Mundaka, Taittir\u00eeyaka, Brihad\u00e2ranyaka, Svet\u00e2svatara, Pras\u00f1a, and Maitr\u00e2yana Br\u00e2hmana Upanishads. Thirty Minor Upanishads by K. Narayanasvami Aiyar [1914] Thirty shorter Upanishads, principally dealing with Yogic thought and practice. From the Upanishads Charles Johnston, translator [1889] Translations from the Katha, Prasna and Chhandogya Upanishads. Puranas The Puranas are post-Vedic texts which typically contain a complete narrative of the history of the Universe from creation to destruction, genealogies of the kings, heroes and demigods, and descriptions of Hindu cosmology and geography. There are 17 or 18 canonical Puranas, divided into three categories, each named after a deity: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. There are also many other works termed Purana, known as 'Upapuranas.' The Vishnu Purana by H.H. Wilson [1840] A primary text of the Vaishnava branch of Hinduism, and one of the canonical Puranas of the Vishnu category. Among the portions of interest are a cycle of legends of the boyhood deeds of Krishna and Rama. H.H. Wilson was one of the first Europeans to translate a Hindu sacred text from the original Sanskrit. His style and annotations are exceptional and very readable. The Garuda Purana translated by Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam [1911] A Vishnu Purana with Dantesque descriptions of the afterlife, and details of Hindu funeral rites. The S'rimad Dev\u00ee Bh\u00e2gawatam translated by Swami Vijnanananda (Hari Prasanna Chatterji) [1921] One of the Upapuranas, devoted to the Devi (Goddess).

The Epics The Mahabharata and Ramayana are the national epics of India. They are probably the longest poems in any language. The Mahabharata, attributed to the sage Vyasa, was written down from 540 to 300 B.C. The Mahabharata tells the legends of the Bharatas, a Vedic Aryan group. The Ramayana, attributed to the poet Valmiki, was written down during the first century A.D., although it is based on oral traditions that go back six or seven centuries earlier. The Ramayana is a moving love story with moral and spiritual themes that has deep appeal in India to this day. In addition, a key Hindu sacred text, the Bhagavad Gita, is embedded in Book Six of the Mahabharata. Mahabharata The Mahabharata translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli [1883-1896] Digitizing this unabridged translation of the Mahabharata was a joint venture between sacred-texts and Project Gutenberg.

Bhagavad Gita The Bhagavad Gita, usually considered part of the sixth book of the Mahabharata (dating from about 400 or 300 B.C.), is a central text of Hinduism, a philosphical dialog between the god Krishna and the warrior Arjuna. This is one of the most popular and accessible of all Hindu scriptures, required reading for anyone interested in Hinduism. The Gita discusses selflessness, duty, devotion, and meditation, integrating many different threads of Hindu philosophy. The Bhagavadg\u00eet\u00e2 (SBE 8) with the Sanatsug\u00e2t\u00eeya and the Anug\u00eet\u00e2 translated by K\u00e2shin\u00e2th Trimbak Telang, (Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 8) [1882] A scholarly prose translation of the Bhagavad Gita with two other similar, less well known, works from the Mahabharata.

Welcome to the Bhagavad- Gita online. We are happy you have arrived and it will be our pleasure to serve you. Here you will be presented transcendental knowledge of the most profound spiritual nature as revealed in the Bhagavad- Gita. It is the divine discourse spoken by the Supreme Lord Krishna Himself and is the most popular and well known of all the sacred scriptures from ancient India. Always being revered as a true source of spiritual knowledge it reveals the purpose and goal of human existence. In conjunction to this we will be presenting precise Vedic verification of the Supreme Lord Krishna's divine incarnations as evidence confirming His supreme position. In Bhagavad- Gita, chapter 10, verse 20, the Supreme Lord reveals that He manifests as the immortal soul within each and every living entity. No where else within any other religious scripture is this information available. Our purpose is to make the eternal knowledge of Bhagavad- Gita freely available to everyone all over the Earth. Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Chapter 7 Chapter 8 Chapter 9 Chapter 10 Chapter 11 Chapter 12 Chapter 13 Chapter 14 Chapter 15 Chapter 16 Chapter 17 Chapter 18 The Bhagavad- Gita is considered by eastern and western scholars alike to be among the greatest spiritual books the world has ever known. In a very clear and wonderful way the Supreme Lord Krishna describes the science of self-realization and the exact process by which a human being can establish their eternal relationship with God. In terms of pure, spiritual knowledge the Bhagavad- Gita is incomparable. Its intrinsic beauty is that its knowledge applies to all human beings and does not postulate any sectarian idealogy or secular view. It is appproachable from the sanctified realms of all religions and is glorified as the epitome of all spiritual teachings. This is because proficiency in the Bhagavad- Gita reveals the eternal principles which are fundamental and essential for spiritual life from all perspectives and allows one to perfectly understand the esoteric truths hidden within all religious scriptures. Many great thinkers from our times such as Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Schweizer as well as Madhvacarya, Sankara and Ramanuja from bygone ages have all contemplated and deliberarted upon its timeless message. The primary purpose of the Bhagavad- Gita is to illuminate for all of humanity the realization of the true nature of divinity; for the highest spiritual conception and the greatest material perfection is to attain love of God!

        "content": "Introduction to Hinduism - An introduction to Hinduism Skip to content Home Hinduism is one of the world\u2019s oldest religions, primarily practiced in India and Nepal. It is more accurately described as a way of life or a complex cultural system rather than a single, organized religion with a specific founder or set of doctrines. Key aspects of Hinduism include: Beliefs and Philosophy: Hinduism encompasses diverse beliefs, rituals, and philosophies. It is a pluralistic religion, allowing for a wide range of beliefs about concepts like the nature of God, the purpose of life, and the cosmos. Central ideas include dharma (duty/righteousness), karma (action and its consequences), samsara (cycle of rebirth), and moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth). Gods and Goddesses: Hinduism is known for its vast pantheon of gods and goddesses, with different deities representing various aspects of the divine. Some of the major deities include Brahma (the creator), Vishnu (the preserver), Shiva (the destroyer), Lakshmi (goddess of wealth), Saraswati (goddess of knowledge), and many more. Hindus may worship one or multiple deities, believing them to be manifestations of the same ultimate reality. Scriptures: Hinduism has a rich collection of sacred texts, including the Vedas (ancient scriptures), Upanishads (philosophical texts), Ramayana, Mahabharata (which includes the Bhagavad Gita), Puranas, and others. These texts contain religious teachings, stories, myths, and ethical guidelines. Rituals and Practices: Hindu rituals and practices vary widely across regions and sects. They include puja (worship), meditation, yoga, pilgrimage to sacred sites, festivals (such as Diwali, Holi, and Navaratri), and ceremonies marking significant life events like birth, marriage, and death. Caste System: Historically, Hindu society has been characterized by a caste system, dividing people into hierarchical social groups (castes). While its significance has decreased over time due to social reforms, elements of the caste system continue to exist in some parts of society. Diversity and Tolerance: Hinduism is highly diverse and tolerant, allowing for different interpretations, beliefs, and practices. It has accommodated various schools of philosophy and sects over thousands of years. Spiritual Paths: Hinduism offers multiple paths to spiritual realization, known as yogas. These paths include Karma Yoga (the path of selfless action), Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion), Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge), and Raja Yoga (the path of meditation). Hinduism\u2019s rich tapestry encompasses a wide range of beliefs, rituals, customs, and philosophies. Its flexibility and inclusivity have contributed to its endurance and adaptability over millennia. Scroll to Top",

This includes all of the Mahabharata files. Updated 1/22/2005. Errata The following errors have been corrected or noted in the HTML version; the text version has not been altered at this time, so please note the following errata. Most of these were errors in the published edition which we used to construct the etext (the copytext). Book 1. Section CLXXVII should be CLXXVI and vice versa. This was an error in the copytext. Book 2. Section LXVII should be inserted at \"Bhima said, 'O Yudhishthira, gamblers...\" This was a transcription error. Book 7. The copytext omitted section breaks for LIV, LV and CLXXXIX. We believe that no actual text is missing at these points, just the section breaks, since (e.g.) CLXXXIX shows up in the page header in the copytext. Book 13. There are two sections labelled CLXVIII. The first one should be CLXIII. This was an error in the copytext. Book 14. (HTML version only) The HTML title of LXXVII was incorrectly entered as LXVIII. This was a formatting error. --February 26th, 2006 Hold the world's wisdom in the palm of your hand. Over 1700 books. Support the Archive. Buy it here!

        "content": "The Bhagavad-Gita Index | Sacred Texts Archive Sacred Texts Hinduism Gita Society Translation SBE vol. 8 Translation Sanskrit The Bhagavad Gita Translated by Edwin Arnold [1885] The Bhagavad Gita is technically part of Book 6 of the Mahabharata, although it is known to be a later accretion to the saga, which stands on its own merits. It is a dialog between the God Krishna and the hero Arjuna, taking place in a timeless moment on the battlefield before the climactic struggle between good and evil. The Gita (which can be found in hotel bedstands throughout India) is a classic summary of the core beliefs of Hinduism. It has had a significant influence far beyond Hinduism. Robert Oppenheimer apocryphically recited the verse (from Chapter 11) 'I [have become] Death, Destroyer of Worlds\", just before the first test of the atom bomb, which ironically has a much different meaning in context. This has now been cross-referenced with the Sanskrit text. Chapter 1: Of the Distress of Arjuna Chapter 2: Of Doctrines Chapter 3: Virtue in Work. Chapter 4: Of the Religion of Knowledge Chapter 5: Of Religion by Renouncing Fruit of Works Chapter 6: Of Religion of Self-Restraint Chapter 7: Of Religion by Discernment Chapter 8: Of Religion by Devotion to the One Supreme God Chapter 9: Of Religion by the Kingly Knowledge and the Kingly Mystery Chapter 10: Of Religion by the Heavenly Perfections Chapter 11: Of the Manifesting of the One and Manifold Chapter 12: Of the Religion of Faith Chapter 13: Of Religion by Separation of Matter and Spirit Chapter 14: Of Religion by Separation from the Qualities Chapter 15: Of Religion by Attaining the Supreme Chapter 16: Of the Separateness of the Divine and the Undivine Chapter 17: Of Religion by the Threefold Kinds of Faith Chapter 18: Of Religion by Deliverance and Renunciation",
